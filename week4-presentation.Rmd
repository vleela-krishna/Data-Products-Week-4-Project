## Overview

This presentation is a part of deliverable required for Data Products Course week 4 project.

The application demo built by Shiny and can be found at the URL:
https://vleelakrishna.shinyapps.io/data-products-week-4-project/

Source code is at GitHub for the application and presnetation at the URL:
https://github.com/vleela-krishna/Data-Products-Week-4-Project

## Web Application

This web application calculates linear regression of different variables at MTCars data set. The application provides user with three different inputs:

* Select first variable of the regression either:

    + Mile per Gallon (mpg),
    + or Horse Power (hp),
  
* Select second variable one of three: 

    + Cylinders, 
    + Transmission, 
    + and Gears
  
* User can select if he\ she wants to show straight line representing linear prediction or not.


## MTCars data set

This is the data of MTCars Dataset with various columns where we build a linear regression model among variables across all data at the dataset.

```{r mtcars, echo = TRUE}
head(mtcars)
```

## Sample Layout of Linear Regression (mpg ~ cyl)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

data("mtcars")
 mtcars.cyl.formula <- mpg ~ cyl
    mtcars.cyl.lm <- lm(formula=mtcars.cyl.formula, data=mtcars)
     
    
    # draw the scatter diagram with the specified value of mpg
      plot(mtcars.cyl.formula, data=mtcars)
      abline(mtcars.cyl.lm,col="Red")
```
